# There are n children standing in a line.

# Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

# You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

# Each child must have at least one candy.
# Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
# Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
# Example 2:

# Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
# The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= n == ratings.length <= 5 * 104
# 0 <= ratings[i] <= 5 * 104
