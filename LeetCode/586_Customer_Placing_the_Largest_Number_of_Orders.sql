# Table: Orders

# +-----------------+----------+
# | Column Name     | Type     |
# +-----------------+----------+
# | order_number    | int      |
# | customer_number | int      |
# +-----------------+----------+
# order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 

# Write a solution to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

# The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# Orders table:
# +--------------+-----------------+
# | order_number | customer_number |
# +--------------+-----------------+
# | 1            | 1               |
# | 2            | 2               |
# | 3            | 3               |
# | 4            | 3               |
# +--------------+-----------------+
# Output: 
# +-----------------+
# | customer_number |
# +-----------------+
# | 3               |
# +-----------------+
# Explanation: SELECT customer_number
# FROM Orders
# GROUP BY customer_number
# ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
# LIMIT 1;
# The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
# So the result is customer_number 3.








# SQL Schema:
# Create table If Not Exists orders (order_number int, customer_number int)
# Truncate table orders
# insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('1', '1')
# insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('2', '2')
# insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('3', '3')
# insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('4', '3')








# SQL Solution:
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
