# Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.

# The steps of the insertion sort algorithm:

# Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
# At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
# It repeats until no input elements remain.
# The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.


 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
# Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000


# Brute force:
class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head):
        dummy = ListNode(0)

        curr = head

        while curr:
            # Current node ko save karo
            next_node = curr.next

            # Sorted list mein position find karo
            prev = dummy

            while prev.next and prev.next.val < curr.val:
                prev = prev.next

            # curr ko correct position par insert karo
            curr.next = prev.next
            prev.next = curr

            # Next input node
            curr = next_node

        return dummy.next






# Optimal:
class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head):
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = head

        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next

            # Sorted list mein position find karo
            prev = dummy

            while prev.next and prev.next.val < curr.val:
                prev = prev.next

            # curr ko correct position par insert karo
            curr.next = prev.next
            prev.next = curr

            # Next node
            curr = next_node

        return dummy.next
