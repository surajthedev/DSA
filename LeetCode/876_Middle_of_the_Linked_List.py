# Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.



# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [3,4,5]
# Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: [4,5,6]
# Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
# Brute force:
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        nodes = []
        curr = head

        while curr:
            nodes.append(curr)
            curr = curr.next

        return nodes[len(nodes) // 2]











# Optimal:
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        return slow
