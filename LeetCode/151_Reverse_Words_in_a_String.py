# Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

# A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

# Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

# Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "the sky is blue"
# Output: "blue is sky the"
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "  hello world  "
# Output: "world hello"
# Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "a good   example"
# Output: "example good a"
# Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
# There is at least one word in s.
 




# Brute force:
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split()

        words.reverse()

        return " ".join(words)






# Optimal:
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        i = n - 1
        result = []

        while i >= 0:

            # Spaces skip karo
            while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
                i -= 1

            if i < 0:
                break

            # Word ka end
            end = i

            # Word ka start find karo
            while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ':
                i -= 1

            # Word add karo
            result.append(s[i + 1:end + 1])

        return " ".join(result)
