# Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

# Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

# Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.



# Example 1:

# Input: k = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
# Example 2:

# Input: k = 2
# Output: -1
# Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
# Example 3:

# Input: k = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.


# Constraints:

# 1 <= k <= 105
#
#
#
#

# ### Brute Force

python
```
class Solution:
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, k: int) -> int:
        if k % 2 == 0 or k % 5 == 0:
            return -1

        n = 0
        length = 0

        while True:
            n = n * 10 + 1
            length += 1

            if n % k == 0:
                return length
```

### Optimal

python
```
class Solution:
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, k: int) -> int:
        if k % 2 == 0 or k % 5 == 0:
            return -1

        remainder = 0

        for length in range(1, k + 1):
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % k

            if remainder == 0:
                return length

        return -1
```
