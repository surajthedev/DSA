# Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

# You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

# For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: x = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: x = 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 

# Constraints:

# 0 <= x <= 231 - 1



# Brute Force:
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:

        i = 0

        while (i * i) <= x:
            i += 1

        return i - 1





# Optimal:
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:

        if x < 2:
            return x

        low = 1
        high = x
        ans = 0

        while low <= high:

            mid = (low + high) // 2

            square = mid * mid

            if square == x:
                return mid

            elif square < x:
                ans = mid
                low = mid + 1

            else:
                high = mid - 1

        return ans
