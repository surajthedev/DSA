# You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

# There are two types of logs:

# Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
# Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
# Reorder these logs so that:

# The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
# The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
# The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
# Return the final order of the logs.



# Example 1:

# Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
# Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
# Explanation:
# The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
# The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".
# Example 2:

# Input: logs = ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
# Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]


# Constraints:

# 1 <= logs.length <= 100
# 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
# All the tokens of logs[i] are separated by a single space.
# logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier and at least one word after the identifier.
