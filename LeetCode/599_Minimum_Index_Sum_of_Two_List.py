# Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

# A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

# A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

# Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
# Example 2:

# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
# Example 3:

# Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
# Output: ["sad","happy"]
# Explanation: There are three common strings:
# "happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
# "sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
# "good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
# The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000
# 1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30
# list1[i] and list2[i] consist of spaces ' ' and English letters.
# All the strings of list1 are unique.
# All the strings of list2 are unique.
# There is at least a common string between list1 and list2.

        ans = []

        for i in range(len(list1)):
            for j in range(len(list2)):
                if list1[i] == list2[j]:
                    index_sum = i + j

                    if index_sum < min_sum:
                        min_sum = index_sum
                        ans = [list1[i]]

                    elif index_sum == min_sum:
                        ans.append(list1[i])

        return ans

                index_sum = i + j

                if index_sum < min_sum:
