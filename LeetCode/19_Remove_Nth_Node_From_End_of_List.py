# Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
# Example 2:

# Input: head = [1], n = 1
# Output: []
# Example 3:

# Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
# Output: [1]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 30
# 0 <= Node.val <= 100
# 1 <= n <= sz



# Brute Force:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        # Count total nodes
        length = 0
        curr = head

        while curr:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next

        # If first node needs to be removed
        if length == n:
            return head.next

        # Find previous node
        curr = head
        for _ in range(length - n - 1):
            curr = curr.next

        # Delete node
        curr.next = curr.next.next

        return head






# Optimal:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head

        fast = dummy
        slow = dummy

        # Move fast pointer n+1 steps
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next

        # Move both pointers
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        # Remove nth node
        slow.next = slow.next.next

        return dummy.next
