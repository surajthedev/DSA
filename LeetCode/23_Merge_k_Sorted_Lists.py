# You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

# Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
# Explanation: The linked-lists are:
# [
#   1->4->5,
#   1->3->4,
#   2->6
# ]
# merging them into one sorted linked list:
# 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
# Example 2:

# Input: lists = []
# Output: []
# Example 3:

# Input: lists = [[]]
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# k == lists.length
# 0 <= k <= 104
# 0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
# -104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
# lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
# The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.

# Brute Force:
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        arr = []

        # Store all values
        for head in lists:
            while head:
                arr.append(head.val)
                head = head.next

        # Sort values
        arr.sort()

        # Create new linked list
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy

        for val in arr:
            curr.next = ListNode(val)
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy

        while heap:
            val, i, node = heapq.heappop(heap)

            curr.next = node
            curr = curr.next

            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, i, node.next))

        return dummy.next
