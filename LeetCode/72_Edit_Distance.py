# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

# You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

# Insert a character
# Delete a character
# Replace a character
 

# Example 1:

# Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
# rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
# rose -> ros (remove 'e')
# Example 2:

# Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# intention -> inention (remove 't')
# inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
# enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
# exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
# exection -> execution (insert 'u')
 

# Constraints:

# 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
# word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.


# Brute Force:
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:

        def solve(i, j):

            if i == len(word1):
                return len(word2) - j

            if j == len(word2):
                return len(word1) - i

            if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                return solve(i + 1, j + 1)

            insert = 1 + solve(i, j + 1)
            delete = 1 + solve(i + 1, j)
            replace = 1 + solve(i + 1, j + 1)

            return min(insert, delete, replace)

        return solve(0, 0)




# Optimal:
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:

        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)

        next_row = [n - j for j in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):

            curr = [0] * (n + 1)
            curr[n] = m - i

            for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

                if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                    curr[j] = next_row[j + 1]
                else:
                    curr[j] = 1 + min(
                        curr[j + 1],
                        next_row[j],
                        next_row[j + 1]
                    )

            next_row = curr

        return next_row[0]
